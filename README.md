#üìå Project Description ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis with NLP
This project was developed as part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS in the Machine Learning domain. The objective was to implement a Sentiment Analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The entire development process was carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which served as the primary development environment due to its simplicity, powerful extensions, and built-in terminal.

üîç Project Objective
The goal of the task was to design and implement a machine learning pipeline that could analyze short text inputs and classify them based on sentiment ‚Äî typically into positive or negative categories. Sentiment analysis is widely used in customer feedback systems, product reviews, social media monitoring, and more. This project aimed to provide hands-on experience with text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.

üß† Task Performed
The following steps were undertaken during the implementation:

Data Preparation:
A small labeled dataset of text samples was prepared manually. These sentences reflected either positive or negative emotions and served as training data for the classifier.

Text Preprocessing:
Using the nltk library, the raw text data was cleaned and processed. This included:

Converting all text to lowercase

Tokenizing sentences into words

Removing common stopwords (like "is", "the", "and")

Feature Extraction:
To transform text into a format suitable for machine learning, I used CountVectorizer from scikit-learn, which implements the Bag of Words model. This converted the processed text into numerical feature vectors.

Model Training:
A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier from scikit-learn was used to train the model on the labeled data. This algorithm is particularly effective for text-based classification problems due to its speed and simplicity.

Prediction & Evaluation:
The trained model was tested using a separate list of text samples. The predicted sentiment for each input was printed alongside the input, allowing for easy interpretation of results.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Tools Used
Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries: nltk, scikit-learn

IDE/Editor: Visual Studio Code

Platform: Windows 11

Execution: VS Code terminal with pip and Python commands

üí° Why Visual Studio Code?
VS Code was chosen because of its lightweight nature, excellent support for Python, and features like real-time syntax checking, integrated terminal, and intelligent code suggestions. The Python extension provided linting, debugging tools, and easy virtual environment management, making development faster and more efficient.

‚úÖ Outcomes and Learning
Gained practical experience in Natural Language Processing

Learned how to use nltk for text preprocessing and tokenization

Understood how machine learning models can be trained on text data

Explored feature extraction using CountVectorizer

Improved proficiency in Python and the scikit-learn library

Learned how to debug and run Python scripts within a professional IDE

Additionally, I gained experience dealing with common errors like package installation issues and network-related problems, which helped build my troubleshooting skills.

üèÅ Conclusion
The Sentiment Analysis project gave me a clear understanding of how to build a real-world NLP model using Python. From data cleaning to model evaluation, each step enhanced my knowledge of machine learning workflows. The project also helped me become more confident in using development tools like Visual Studio Code and Python libraries such as nltk and scikit-learn.

This repository contains the full implementation of the project, including the code, necessary instructions, and sample data. This experience has been instrumental in strengthening both my technical and problem-solving skills, which will be useful in future academic and professional machine learning projects.
