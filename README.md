ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€“ Sentiment Analysis with NLP
This project is a part of my internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, focused on understanding and implementing a Sentiment Analysis model using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The objective of this task was to analyze short text data, identify the sentiment (positive or negative), and build a machine learning pipeline to automate the classification process. The entire development and execution of the project were carried out using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on a Windows platform.

Sentiment analysis is a key application of NLP that involves extracting emotional tone or opinion from text. It is widely used in analyzing customer feedback, product reviews, and social media posts. The goal is to determine whether a given piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or sometimes neutral sentiment. In this project, we focused on binary classification: identifying whether the sentiment expressed in a sentence was positive or negative.

A simple dataset was created manually with labeled examples representing both sentiment classes. The focus was on implementing the core NLP steps â€” preprocessing the text, extracting relevant features, training a classification model, and evaluating its performance.

Key Steps in the Project:
Importing Libraries:
I used nltk for natural language processing tasks and scikit-learn for feature extraction and model building.

Preparing the Dataset:
A small dataset was manually constructed with sentences labeled as either positive or negative. This dataset served as both the training and testing base for the model.

Text Preprocessing:
Using nltk, each sentence was tokenized, converted to lowercase, and stripped of stopwords and punctuation. This helped normalize the input and reduce noise.

Feature Extraction:
The cleaned text was transformed into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer from scikit-learn, which applies the Bag-of-Words model to convert words into count-based features.

Model Training:
I used the MultinomialNB classifier, a Naive Bayes variant well-suited for text classification. The model was trained on the extracted features and their corresponding sentiment labels.

Prediction and Evaluation:
After training, the model was tested on a set of new sentences to predict their sentiment. The output was printed in the terminal showing the input sentence and its predicted sentiment (positive/negative).

Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: nltk, scikit-learn

IDE: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Platform: Windows 11

Execution: VS Code terminal using pip and Python

Why Visual Studio Code?
VS Code was chosen for its Python-friendly environment, clean interface, and built-in tools like the terminal and debugger. It allowed me to manage packages, write and test Python code efficiently, and visualize outputs directly. Features like syntax highlighting, linting, and integrated Git support made it an ideal platform for machine learning experimentation and model development.

Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of natural language processing, particularly in the area of text cleaning, feature engineering, and sentiment classification. I became comfortable using nltk for basic NLP tasks and learned how to convert unstructured text into machine-readable formats using CountVectorizer.

I also enhanced my understanding of Naive Bayes classifiers and their application in binary text classification. Additionally, I learned how to structure small machine learning projects, troubleshoot Python package installation issues, and run end-to-end Python code inside VS Code.

The project taught me how sentiment analysis models can be applied to solve real-world problems such as product review analysis, feedback classification, and opinion mining. The experience also improved my confidence in writing modular, reusable code and documenting ML workflows clearly.

Conclusion:
The Sentiment Analysis with NLP project was a highly insightful part of my internship experience. It helped me apply theoretical concepts in practical coding, strengthened my machine learning foundation, and enhanced my ability to work with textual data. The project flow â€” from data preprocessing to prediction â€” was a complete hands-on cycle of an NLP solution. These learnings are valuable assets for my future academic projects and professional development in data science.

This GitHub repository contains the complete implementation of the project, including Python source code, instructions to run it, and a sample dataset for testing.
